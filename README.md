# CS50

Hii all,

I just wrote this small BASH script to Setup CS50 Appliance in Host Machine (Ubuntu Family).
To use this script download the cs50.sh file and execute. It will install all the programs needed for CS50.

To execute follow the below steps:

sh ./cs50.sh

To become root you may use sudo.

Example: sudo sh ./cs50.sh
